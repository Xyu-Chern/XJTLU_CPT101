## Supplyment
- I will update a new version may be in 24summer to revise many faults
- To be honest , this lesson taught is very easy and you can just learn it in two weeks ,but please do not complain to your teacher ( mostly will be [Steven Guan](https://www.xjtlu.edu.cn/en/departments/academic-departments/computer-science-and-software-engineering/staff/steven-guan) ): Everyone has its own main hardships, which you can not see from a student perspective.
